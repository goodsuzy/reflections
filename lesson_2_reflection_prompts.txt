What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A working tree is being organised. Git gets itself ready to record changes via time, commit id & description.
You ahve to initialise in the parent folder of the entire project using git init. commit then is 0. no objects in the commit as well. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

Staging area is the container holding all operable files (script files) under git. 
Repository holds the commits and logs the changes.
Working directory holds Repository,Staging Area and the other files
You initialise the Repository. Then you add items into the staging area. Things within this container will have their commits logged.
