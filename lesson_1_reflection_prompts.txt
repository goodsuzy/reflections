How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It highlights  the differences between the files. Diff on UNIX based. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could chnage the direction of where the program needs to go easily and find out exactly where the problem is. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    1. KNows that you are saving a complete code
    2. Doesn't require internet access. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is meant for coding. Doc is not meant for coding- that's why. We need to keep things seperated in Coding for easier implementation of changes or for debugging. 
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    GIT LOG: Shows COMMIT git log commitid1 commitid2
    GIT DIFF: Shows difference in file VERSION. 
    git diff commitid1 commitid2 (compares saved Jpeg 1 and saved Jpeg 2- may not be LAST saved jpeg)
    git diff with no arguments: compares current * and staging area's version. (compares PSD file to current existing Jpeg)
    git diff --staged: compares staging area & last commit. (current jpeg vs last saved jpeg)
    
    Diff: Shows difference in 2 files. diff filename1 filename2
    git log --stat: shows commit title and the number of changes + for addition and - for removal of codes. 
    q: to get out of seeing the codes.
    git clone 
    git config --global color.ui auto
    Ctrl+Shift+Y and Ctrl+Shift+V (TO copy & paste in GIT)
    Use Up and Down to scroll the logs
    git checkout commitID. type this once and run html again. html will use the older ID. note: git log after this process, will only show up to commitID.
    to create a git respository, go to working directory (folder) with all your files. type "git init". type "ls -a". now the hidden .git repository is shown. #ofcommit=0. use "git add" to add objects/files to the repository for tracking (staging area). 
    git status: shows the current Head, objects that is tracked and untracked. 
    git's HEAD= current commit
    git commit to write a commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
